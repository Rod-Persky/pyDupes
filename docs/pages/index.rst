|project|
==========

This is the documentation for |project|. Ultimately |project| is a program to do what's on the tin.

The primary goal of this project is to dedupe across a number of computers in a cooperative manner,
also it's completely free, and will will not persue a premium program. Realistically, deduplication
can be as easy as coming up with a few methods and then iterating across all the files specified -
it boggles my tiny mind how people can justify selling a program that does such a simple set of tasks; perhaps
it is down to the authors feel that they need to be always around to support their programs users.

This project perhaps unlike the others doesn't want to give you the illusion that you are supported
24/7, nobody (especially myself) has time for that. Instead, I aim to make the programming of this
as simple as possible - and have good documentation too. So without further ado, the following is
a list of topics that you will probably want to read up on with how to use this program and how
to extend this program. Again, realistically, the concept of this program is simple - find all duplicates
and delete all but one.
